# Unified IOD Lab Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to create comprehensive single-page views of your IOD labs using the unified deployment script.

## 🎯 What is Unified Deployment?

Instead of having separate files scattered across folders, the unified deployment creates a **single comprehensive page** that displays all exercises from a lab module together with:

- **📊 Overview dashboard** showing all exercises at a glance
- **🎨 Tabbed navigation** to switch between exercises
- **🖥️ Live HTML previews** embedded directly in the page
- **💻 Interactive JavaScript execution** with run buttons
- **📱 Responsive design** that works on all devices

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# From IOD root directory
./Deployment/deploy-unified.sh Module1Lab

# OR from Deployment directory
cd Deployment
./deploy-unified.sh Module1Lab
```

## 📋 What Gets Created

### For Module1Lab Example:
- **Exercise2.html** → Live HTML preview in iframe
- **Exercise3.html** → Interactive HTML/CSS/JS demo  
- **Exercise4.js** → JavaScript with "Run Code" button
- **Exercise5.js** → More JavaScript exercises
- **Exercise8/** → Complete project (dice simulator)

All displayed in one beautiful, navigable interface!

## 🎨 Interface Features

### Overview Dashboard
- **Grid layout** showing all exercises as cards
- **Exercise types** clearly labeled (HTML, JavaScript, Complete Project)
- **Click to navigate** directly to any exercise
- **Visual indicators** for different exercise types

### Exercise Views
- **HTML Exercises**: Full iframe previews showing your work
- **JavaScript Exercises**: 
  - Syntax-highlighted code display
  - "Run Code" buttons for instant execution
  - Console output displayed on page
- **Complete Projects**: Full project view with all functionality

### Navigation
- **Tab-based switching** between exercises
- **Overview button** to return to dashboard
- **Smooth animations** and transitions
- **Mobile-friendly** responsive design

## 🔧 How It Works

### Auto-Detection
The script automatically finds and processes:

1. **HTML files** (`*.html`) → Creates iframe previews
2. **JavaScript files** (`*.js`) → Creates interactive code viewers
3. **Subdirectories** with `index.html` → Embeds complete projects
4. **Assets** (CSS, images) → Copies and preserves references

### Content Processing
- **HTML exercises** are embedded as live iframes
- **JavaScript code** is syntax-highlighted and made executable
- **CSS files** are linked properly to maintain styling
- **Images and assets** are copied to maintain functionality

## 🌐 Deployment Result

Your unified lab will be available at:
- **Live URL**: https://tatoslover.github.io/IOD/ModuleXLab
- **Features**: Complete single-page application showcasing all your work
