## Description

This file contains the exercises for IOD Labs

## Exercise 1

Practice using the commands you learnt to solve the following:
- Create a new folder
- Create another folder inside the first one
- Print the contents of the first folder
- Change directory to the second folder, and print the current path
- Change directory back to the original starting place
- Delete the first folder

Extension: Research the cp, mv, cat and find commands, and experiment!

## Exercise 2

1. Open (or create) your Module1 folder in VS Code.
2. Use the Terminal feature of VS Code to issue commands to create a new folder inside Module1 for LabExercises and change into it.
3. Inside the above folder, create a new file called exercise2.html
4. As the first character in this file, type an exclamation mark ! and use the Emmet abbreviation to generate a basic HTML skeleton
5. Populate the <body> with basic HTML representing these lab steps
6. Go Live to view and test the HTML
7. Install Prettier VSCode extension and format selected code with Ctrl-K-F
8. Read through Dealing with files on the MDN for more tips about website file systems.

## Exercise 3

<img src="Extras/E3.png" alt="E3" style="max-width: 400px; height: auto;" />

Using this code as a starter:
1. Add an image to each column
2. Add a ‘Change Me’ button under each heading
3. Style your buttons with CSS
4. Add a script tag with two JS functions, one for each button
5. Clicking each button should change the background colour and the heading text for that column.

Extension 1: Add text fields under the headings, and replace the heading text with
the value of the text fields when the buttons are clicked!

Extension 2: Move the CSS and JS code into external files linked from the HTML.

## Exercise 4

Use the learnings from this lesson to design some very simple functions.
Call them with different values.
- Create 4 functions for the 4 main mathematical operations (-,+,/,*).
  Return the calculated value and then output it to the screen.
- Create a function that takes the name of a person as an argument, and prints out “Hello <name>” to the console.
  Hint: search online on how to concatenate two strings.
