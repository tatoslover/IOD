                <p>
                    This project brief outlines a well-structured plan for
                    developing a machine learning model to predict the retail
                    prices of LEGO sets based on characteristics such as theme,
                    piece count, release year, and condition. It demonstrates
                    strong project management through a clear timeline,
                    thoughtful use of resources (including R, Shiny, and
                    Quarto), and strategic data sourcing from platforms like
                    Rebrickable and Brickset. The brief balances exploratory
                    analysis (e.g., data visualisation and time series trends)
                    with predictive modeling, while also considering real-world
                    relevance for LEGO collectors and investors. Built-in
                    flexibility allows for scope expansion or troubleshooting,
                    and the use of inflation-adjusted pricing shows attention to
                    context and accuracy.

                <p>
                    The data processing report is a rendered RMarkdown notebook
                    that documents the cleaning, transformation, and integration
                    of four distinct LEGO-related datasets. It details custom
                    functions, handling of missing values, inflation
                    adjustments, and category classification via web scraping.
                    This document served as the backbone for creating the final
                    enriched dataset (Merged) used for analysis and modelling.

                <p>
                    The formal report presents a comprehensive overview of the
                    project, detailing the objectives, data sources,
                    methodology, and results of analysis. It includes sections
                    on data cleaning, visualisation, and machine learning models
                    used to explore and predict LEGO set resale prices. Key
                    insights are drawn from analyses of set dimensions,
                    categories, and pricing trends. The report also discusses
                    limitations, proposes areas for future research, and is
                    supported by detailed appendices containing data tables,
                    figures, and code outputs.
