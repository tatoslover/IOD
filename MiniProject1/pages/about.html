<h2>About</h2>

<p>
    This project showcases NBA players with advanced stats pulled from 2K
    ratings and the NBA Stats API.
</p>
<p>
    Users can filter players by team, position, and advanced metrics to explore
    performance insights through an interactive interface.
</p>
<p>Created by me, [Your Name], in 2025 as part of a web development project.</p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>
    I built this app to explore how web technologies like JavaScript, APIs, and
    DOM manipulation can be used to present complex sports data in an accessible
    way. It's designed to be engaging for NBA fans, while demonstrating key
    front-end development skills.
</p>

<h3>How to Use</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate using the tabs: About, Players, and Arena.</li>
    <li>
        On the Players page, filter by team, position, or sort by advanced
        metrics like PER, VORP, or TS%.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Arena tab showcases a game-like interaction between teams or players
        (under development).
    </li>
</ol>

            >What was your requirements gathering and design process? Was it
            useful/successful?</strong
        ><br />
        I started by defining core features like filtering and tabbed
        navigation, then sketched a structure to build on. It helped me stay
        focused and break the app into manageable chunks.

    <li>
        <strong
            >Give a high-level overview of your application and its
            features</strong
        ><br />
        It’s a single-page NBA player browser with advanced stat filtering and a
        prototype arena interaction. Tabs keep content organized.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Where does its data come from?</strong><br />
        I scrape some stats from <em>2kratings.com</em> and pull others from the
        NBA Stats API.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>How is this data processed and displayed?</strong><br />
        The data is loaded as JSON, filtered with JS array functions, and
        rendered into HTML using templates and DOM manipulation.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>How can the user interact with your application?</strong><br />
        They can switch tabs, select filters, and view updated player lists
        based on their preferences.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>What JS techniques have you used?</strong><br />
        I’ve used modules, async functions, event handling, DOM manipulation,
        array methods, and utility functions.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>What external tools/libraries have you used?</strong><br />
        I use Bootstrap for styling and possibly Axios for API calls if needed.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>What kinds of HTML elements have you used?</strong><br />
        Divs, buttons, nav links, headings, paragraphs, dropdowns, and HTML
        templates.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>What kinds of CSS features have you used?</strong><br />
        Flexbox for layout, Bootstrap for components, and custom styles for
        spacing, colors, and font tweaks.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong
            >How might you extend the features of your application in
            future?</strong
        ><br />
        Add a full player comparison view, chart-based stat visualization, team
        pages, and more complete arena simulations.
