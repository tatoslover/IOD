# Christchurch Tattoo Social App – Planning Document

## Project Brief

Create a Figma prototype for a social media application, where you can post your content and posts from other users are visible. Don’t just jump into Figma, try to follow the design procedure by first clarifying the requirements, understanding the application flow, and sketching a quick paper mockup.

Also, this could be part of your portfolio, so try to do some research and come up with a personal design. For example, it could be a social media application dedicated to the Warhammer Community, or the Ferrari Lovers.

## Project Overview

This app is designed for the Christchurch tattoo community. Local artists and tattoo enthusiasts can connect, share their work, and get inspired. Users can post photos, follow artists, discover studios on a map, and even book consultations. It’s all about celebrating and growing the local tattoo scene.

## Welcome Blurb

Unlike general social media platforms, **TatūTahi** is tailored to the Christchurch tattoo scene — it’s hyperlocal, artist-focused, and built for meaningful connections. By showcasing local talent and helping users find trusted artists, the app empowers both creators and clients.
